title: Multimodal Object Description Corpus
permalink: /research/object/
---


## The Data
This corpus pairs each real-life photograph with a natural language description (in English) and around 5 hand-drawn sketches. The photographs were sampled from the [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) database. Each object description is composed of an object category label and descriptions of object attributes, collected using the Crowdflower service.  The hand-drawn sketches were selected from an existing corpus -- the [Sketchy dataset](http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/) which contains 125,000 sketches collected using Amazon MTurk. As the sketches and the natural langugae description complement each other, the corpus makes it possible to investigate the interplay between iconic (sketch) and symbolic (language) semantics.

## Resource details
The corpus includes:

- 10, 805 real-life photographs, selected from [ImageNet](www.image-net.org) which are paired with hand-drawn sketches in the [Sketchy dataset](http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/) .
-  10, 805 natural language descriptions of the objects in the photographs, collected from English speakers using the Crowdflower service.
-  hand-drawn sketches of each photograph, selected from the [Sketchy dataset](http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/), stored as SVG files.
